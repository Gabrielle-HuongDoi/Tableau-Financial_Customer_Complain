### Financial Customer complains

In this project, we will use Tableau to visualize the Financial Customer Complain data.
This data is downloaded from https://data.world/markbradbourne/rwfd-real-world-fake-data. It is a page that creates fake dataset in various fields, 
mostly in the social section.

This project only practice some skills in:
  - Create bar charts, line charts, pie chart...
  - Join 2 table by the key column
  - Dual axis
  - Aggregate functions
  - Simple US state map by xy-plane. (The Hex tile maps in tableau is presented in https://www.sirvizalot.com/)
